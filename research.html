            <h3 class="text-light-green">Overview</h3>
            <p>As DNA and ancestry companies continue to compile millions of genetic information samples
                into a database, controversy surrounding whether or not this is ethical. In fact, Ancestry and 23andMe
                have collectively obtained more than 23 million DNA samples in their databases. (<a

                to analyze the publicâ€™s sentiment on DNA fingerprinting, which is one such application of creating a DNA
                database, a script written in Python using Google Colab was created to search the Twitter API for a list
                of keywords </p>

            <p>Through sentiment analysis, it is possible to determine the public's opinnion on DNA fingerprinting.
                <code>Genetic profiling</code> contained tweets with the most positive sentiment (0.13), while
                <code>genetic fingerprinting</code> contained tweets with the most negative sentiment. Taking the
                average sentiment across all keywords reveals that the average sentiment is <code>0.06</code> This
                reflects that the public has a slightly positive sentiment when it comes to discussing DNA
                fingerprinting.

            <p>Through subjectivity analysis, it was possible to determine how objective or subjective tweets about a
                keyword were. For example, <code>dna fingerprinting</code> contained tweets that were the most
                objective (0.35), while <code>genetic profiling</code> contained tweets that were the most subjective
                (0.45). Taking the average of all keywords in subjectivity analysis reveals that the average
                subjectivity was <code>0.398</code>. This means that on averge, the public typically is more objective
                than subjective when it comes to talking about DNA fingerprinting</p>

                <li>
                    The range in sentiment scores was only <code>0.2</code>, which may be explained
                    by just the timespan in which tweets were collected, rather than the overall sentiment over time.
                </li>
                <li>The range in subjectivity scores was only <code>0.10</code>, which may be small enough to be
                    accounted for in confidence errors by the subjectivity analysis model.</li>
                <li>Since we did not have access to the Twitter's research API we were not able to search for tweets in
                    all of Twitter's history, only within a set month. These results may be different than the results
                    resulting from querying for tweets from all of Twitter's datbases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-light-green">Further Research</h3>
            <p>Further research could be done in the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Instead of querying Twitter's API for tweets over the span of a month, query their overall database
                    for tweetes in all of time.</li>
                <li>The source code linked above could be adjusted to perform sentiment analysis on ANY project. All you
                    would need to do is add your API developer keys and change keywords to search for!</li>
