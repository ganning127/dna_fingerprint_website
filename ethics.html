            <h2 class="text-light-green bold">Critics of DNA Fingerprinting</h2>
            <div class="critics">
                <p>37 years after DNA fingerprinting was discovered by Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, DNA typing has
                    become an
                    integral
                    part of modern crime-solving. The National Database of DNA has grown exponentially. Now, many
                    individuals are concerned about personal privacy when information is not only stored about
                    crimminals
                    but about a much wider range of people.
                </p>
                <div class="bias">
                    <h3 class="text-light-green">Interpretation and Human Bias</h3>
                    <p>In Itiel E Dror and Greg Hampikian’s 2011 study, when 17 North American expert DNA scientists
                        with
                        around
                        8.9 years of experience each interpreted a single DNA mixture collected from a real adjudicated
                        crime
                        scene, they produced inconsistent conclusions, suggesting subjectivity and bias [4].
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        In fact, only
                        1 interpreter out of the 17 gave the same conclusion as the original crime scene conclusion
                        [4].
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>According to Dror and Hampikian, the knowledge of each interpreter about the investigation of the
                        crime
                        impacted the interpretation of the DNA sample. For example, an interpreter may analyze
                        information
                        in a
                        biased way to fit their own existing beliefs, hopes, or motivations [4]. If DNA
                        fingerprinting
                        was
                        truly objective, then all of the examiners would have reached the same conclusions.
                    </p>

                    <p>This may lead to the wrongly accused individuals ending up with emotional or reputational damage,
                        negatively affecting them in their future careers and life.
                    </p>

                    <p>Furthermore, It has been long believed that DNA is the “gold standard” of forensic science, free
                        of all
                        subjectivity. The supposed accuracy of DNA fingerprinting results leads investigators to not
                        pursue a
                        larger range of suspects, as they believe that the suspect in the DNA sample is the only one,
                        when
                        the
                        DNA sample may have been interpreted incorrectly.

                <div class="racial-considerations">
                    <h3 class="text-light-green">Racial Considerations</h3>

                    <p>According to many legal scholars such as Hank Greely and Dorothy Roberts, there are more African
                        and
                        Latino individuals who are already in the databases of the criminal justice system [1].
                    </p>
                    <p>Indeed, in 2010, African Americans accounted for 27% of all adult arrests when the total Black
                        population was 12%. In other countries, African Americans make up 52% of the population and
                        account
                        for over 85% of arrests [1]. This leads to more African Americans having their DNA in a national
                        database than other races, leading them to have a higher likelihood of a match with another
                        suspect's DNA.
                    </p>

                <div class="privacy-concerns">
                    <h3 class="text-light-green">Privacy Concerns</h3>
                    <p>According to a study by David J. Kaufman, the public is very concerned about genetic privacy and
                        who
                        has access to their DNA information [6]. </p>
                    <p>A survey of <span class="text-light-green bold">4659</span> U.S. adults revealed that:
                    </p>

                    <canvas id="privacy_chart" class="my-4"></canvas>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="text-light-red">90%</span> would be concerned about privacy</li>
                        <li><span class="text-light-red">56%</span> would be concerned about researchers having their
                            information.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-light-red">37%</span> worry study data being used against them in
                            criminal investigations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Interestingly, when needed, people are more willing to participate in DNA collection:</p>
                    <p>Within that same survey...</p>
                    <canvas id="willing_chart" class="my-4"></canvas>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="text-light-green">60%</span> would participate in a biobank if asked
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="text-light-green">92%</span> would allow academic researchers to use study data
                        </li>
                        <li>Concern about privacy was related to lower willingness to participate only when respondents
                            were
                            told that they would receive $50 for participation and would not receive individual research
                            results back.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This shows that even though people are concerned about their privacy, they are still willing to
                        provide data to researchers if necessary. This willingness of the public matches up with the
                        research on the previous page, in which the overall sentiment of DNA fingerprinting was
                        positive.</p>

                    <p>Many individuals are also worried about the potential of the use of their genetic information to
                        discriminate: for example, getting different kinds of insurance coverage for different prices
                        based
                        on medical history [7].</p>

                    <p>In 2012, privacy concerns lead the United Kingdom to pass the Protection of Freedoms Bill,
                        requiring
                        that all DNA samples be destroyed within 6 months of being taken.
                        As a result, about 1,766,000 DNA profiles of innocent adults and children were deleted from the
                        database [8].

            <h2 class="text-light-green bold">Supporters of DNA Fingerprinting</h2>

            <div class="supporters">
                <p>Supporters of DNA Fingerprinting believe that the practical applications of DNA fingerprinting and
                    its
                    ability to both solve the crime and settle paternity disputes outweigh privacy concerns.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-light-green">Ability to Solve Crime</h3>
                <p>It is much harder for the average individual to prevent the shedding of DNA extracts such as hair
                    follicles, skin flakes, and saliva. In contrast, when needing to take an actual fingerprint, a
                    criminal
                    could wear gloves to cover up their tracks, effectively blocking the investigation.
                </p>
                <p>In fact, DNA fingerprinting was used to arrest the Golden State Killer of 2018, someone who killed at
                    least 13 and raped 50 innocent people. Court documents describe how DNA collected from semen at a
                    crime
                    scene was used to search a database on GEDmatch, a free service that allows individuals to discover
                    their relatives and ancestors. Coincidentally, Joseph James DeAngelo’s profile made a perfect match.
                    Afterward, police needed to confirm the identity of DeAngelo before making the arrest. Law
                    enforcement
                    “lifted traces of DNA” from DeAngelo’s car door while he was shopping at Hobby Lobby. This DNA was
                    compared to genetic fingerprints captured from semen gathered at previous crime scenes. After
                    confirming
                    a match, DeAngelo was arrested on the spot, putting an end to his decade-long eluding of law
                    enforcement
                    [5].
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-light-green">Solve Paternity Disputes</h3>
                <p>Even though the all humans share 99.9% of all DNA, there is still 0.1% that differs between us all.
                    Within that seemingly small difference in DNA, children will have even more DNA in common with their
                    mothers and fathers than complete strangers. When the DNA fingerprint for a child, mother, and
                    father
                    are taken, they can all be ran through gel electrophoresis. A suspect father is more likely to be
                    the
                    biological father if more of his DNA position matches the child's DNA position on the gel.</p>
                <div class="text-center my-4">
                    <img src="./img/gel_ran.png" alt="" class="img-fluid h-30vh ">
                </div>

                <p>In the example above, the child inherited DNA from the mother and the father in multiple sections,
                    meaning that the candidate mother and father are likely the child's biological parents.</p>

            </div>

            <h2 class="text-light-green bold">Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="conclusion">
                <p>Depending on the perspective, there are drastically different views on the ethics behind DNA
                    fingerprinting. Some people believe that having a national database of everyone’s DNA on file is
                    unethical and is an invasion of privacy, while others argue that the potential of DNA fingerprinting
                    to
                    solve crimes and outweighs the drawbacks.</p>
                <p>While it is important to acknowledge the benefits and disadvantages to each side, there are some ways
                    that may be both ethical and agreeable to public opinion to collecting DNA profiles. </p>

                <p>One such method would be to have a voluntary system of DNA collection. Similar to a blood drive,
                    individuals could register their DNA into a national database maintained and encrypted with the
                    highest
                    security. By having genetic information stored, the volunteer is able to be proved innocent in a
                    crime
                    scene investigation. On the other hand, forensic scientists are also able to have another person’s
                    DNA
                    in a repository to assess whether or not someone is part of the suspect pool.
                </p>
                <p>Another way of collecting DNA would be to only collect the DNA of those who are arrested. Since
                    someone
                    was arrested once, and should they be set free eventually, they may have a higher chance of
                    committing a
                    crime again. In such a case, the DNA fingerprint of the person, while they were arrested, would link
                    them as the perpetrator of the second crime. The basis for this method stems from the fact that 83%
                    of
                    state criminals released committed another crime within 9 years of their release [2]. </p>
