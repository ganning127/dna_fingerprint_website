                <h5>Is it <span class="text-light-red">ethical</span> for forensic scientists to use DNA databases
                    containing the genetic

            <h2 class="text-light-green bold">Critics of DNA Fingerprinting</h2>
            <p>37 years after DNA fingerprinting was discovered by Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, it has become an
                integral
                part of modern crime-solving. The National Database of DNA has grown exponentially. Now, many
                individuals are concerned about personal privacy when information is not only stored about crimminals
                but about a much wider range of people.
            </p>
            <div class="bias">
                <h3 class="text-light-green">Interpretation and Human Bias</h3>
                <p>In Itiel E Dror and Greg Hampikian’s 2011 study, when 17 North American expert DNA scientists with
                    around
                    8.9 years of experience each interpreted a single DNA mixture collected from a real adjudicated
                    crime
                    scene, they produced inconsistent conclusions, suggesting subjectivity and bias (SB_DNA).
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    In fact, only
                    1 interpreter out of the 17 gave the same conclusion as the original crime scene conclusion
                    (SB_DNA).
                </blockquote>
                <p>According to Dror and Hampikian, the knowledge of each interpreter about the investigation of the
                    crime
                    impacted the interpretation of the DNA sample. For example, an interpreter may analyze information
                    in a
                    biased way to fit their own existing beliefs, hopes, or motivations (SB_DNA). If DNA fingerprinting
                    was
                    truly objective, then all of the examiners would have reached the same conclusions.
                </p>

                <p>This may lead to the wrongly accused individuals ending up with emotional or reputational damage,
                    negatively affecting them in their future careers and life.
                </p>

                <p>Furthermore, the supposed accuracy of DNA fingerprinting results leads investigators to not pursue a
                    larger range of suspects, as they believe that the suspect in the DNA sample is the only one, when
                    the
                    DNA sample may have been interpreted incorrectly.
                </p>
                <p>It has been long believed that DNA is the “gold standard” of forensic science, free of all
                    subjectivity.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="racial-considerations">
                <h3 class="text-light-green">Racial Considerations</h3>

                <p>According to many legal scholars such as Hank Greely and Dorothy Roberts, there are more African and
                    Latino individuals who are already in the databases of the criminal justice system (PET).
                </p>
                <p>Indeed, in 2010, African Americans accounted for 27% of all adult arrests when the total Black
                    population was 12%. In other countries, African Americans make up 52% of the population and account
                    for over 85% of arrests (PET).

            <div class="privacy-concerns">
                <h3 class="text-light-green">Privacy Concerns</h3>
                <p>According to a study by David J. Kaufman, the public is very concerned about genetic privacy and who
                    has access to their DNA information (K_PRIV). </p>
                <p>A survey of <span class="text-light-green bold">4659</span> U.S. adults revealed that:
                </p>

                <canvas id="privacy_chart" class="my-4"></canvas>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="text-light-red">90%</span> would be concerned about privacy</li>
                    <li><span class="text-light-red">56%</span> would be concerned about researchers having their
                        information.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-light-red">37%</span> worry study data being used against them in
                        criminal investigations</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Interestingly, when needed, people are more willing to participate in DNA collection:</p>
                <p>Within that same survey...</p>
                <canvas id="willing_chart" class="my-4"></canvas>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="text-light-green">60%</span> would participate in a biobank if asked
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="text-light-green">92%</span> would allow academic researchers to use study data
                    </li>
                    <li>Concern about privacy was related to lower willingness to participate only when respondents were
                        told that they would receive $50 for participation and would not receive individual research
                        results back.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Many individuals are also worried about the potential of the use of their genetic information to
                    discriminate: for example, getting different kinds of insurance coverage for different prices based
                    on medical history (GINA).</p>

                <p>In 2012, privacy concerns lead the United Kingdom to pass the Protection of Freedoms Bill, requiring
                    that all DNA samples be destroyed within 6 months of being taken.
                    As a result, about 1,766,000 DNA profiles of innocent adults and children were deleted from the
                    database (YG).
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-light-green bold">Supporters of DNA Fingerprinting</h2>
            <p>Supporters of DNA Fingerprinting believe that the practical applications of DNA fingerprinting and its
                ability to both solve the crime and settle paternity disputes outweigh privacy concerns.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-light-green">Ability to Solve Crime</h3>
            <p>It is much harder for the average individual to prevent the shedding of DNA extracts such as hair
                follicles, skin flakes, and saliva. In contrast, when needing to take an actual fingerprint, a criminal
                could wear gloves to cover up their tracks, effectively blocking the investigation.
            </p>
            <p>In fact, DNA fingerprinting was used to arrest the Golden State Killer of 2018, someone who killed at
                least 13 and raped 50 innocent people. Court documents describe how DNA collected from semen at a crime
                scene was used to search a database on GEDmatch, a free service that allows individuals to discover
                their relatives and ancestors. Coincidentally, Joseph James DeAngelo’s profile made a perfect match.
                Afterward, police needed to confirm the identity of DeAngelo before making the arrest. Law enforcement
                “lifted traces of DNA” from DeAngelo’s car door while he was shopping at Hobby Lobby. This DNA was
                compared to genetic fingerprints captured from semen gathered at previous crime scenes. After confirming
                a match, DeAngelo was arrested on the spot, putting an end to his decade-long eluding of law enforcement
                (DETIME).
